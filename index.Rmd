  We report the results of an experiment to evaluate the impact of transit 
  signal priority (TSP) systems on headway adherence for a bus rapid transit (BRT) system
  in Provo and Orem, Utah. The system will grant TSP if the bus is running behind
  its unpublished schedule; the research question is whether TSP has an effect on
  the headway between vehicles, which is what users perceive.

# Questions {#intro}

Transit signal priority (TSP) is a technology that allows traffic signals to
change their timing plans to accommodate transit vehicles. This may involve
extending a green phase until the vehicle passes, triggering an early green if
there is a vehicle waiting at the light, or even running specific transit-only
phases if the transit vehicles must make a turn across the automobile traffic lanes.
TSP is an important tool in helping transit vehicles maintain on-time
performance [@Liu2018]. Often, TSP will only be triggered at a specific signal
if the vehicle is running some amount behind its schedule, thus maximizing green
time for automobiles and minimizing automobile delay when the bus is otherwise
on schedule [@NI20201]. 

In high-frequency transit systems where the goal is not schedule adherence but
rather *headway* adherence, the schedule might not be published for transit
riders. The specific vehicles might follow an internal schedule, but there could
be a discrepancy when passengers perceive a bus being "late" when it is on-time
by its unpublished schedule. The research questions are therefore:

  - Does TSP improve headway adherence for rapid transit systems?
  - Is there an average improvement, or is there a reduction only in extreme delay?
  - Does the improvement change by time of day or for particular portions of 
  a rapid transit route?
