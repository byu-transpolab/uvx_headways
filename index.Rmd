  We report the results of an experiment to evaluate the impact of transit 
  signal priority (TSP) systems on headway adherence for a bus rapid transit (BRT) system
  in Provo and Orem, Utah. The system will grant TSP if the bus is running behind
  its unpublished schedule; the research question is whether TSP has an effect on
  the headway between vehicles, which is what users perceive.

# Questions {#intro}

Transit signal priority (TSP) allows traffic signals to flexibly accommodate
transit vehicles. This may involve extending a green phase until the vehicle
passes, triggering an early green if there is a vehicle waiting at the light, or
even running specific transit-only phases. TSP helps transit vehicles maintain
on-time performance [@Liu2018], but often TSP will only engage at a signal if
the vehicle is running behind its schedule, thus minimizing automobile delay
when the bus is otherwise on schedule [@NI20201].

In 2018, the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) launched the Utah Valley Express (UVX) 
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Provo and Orem, Utah.  The system connects
two commuter rail stations, two major universities (Brigham Young and Utah Valley),
and commercial districts in Orem and Provo. UVX has TSP on X of the X traffic 
signals along its route. The TSP is triggered when a vehicle is behind its schedule;
however, the system does not publish a schedule and rather attempts to maintain
a specific headway (6 minutes in the peak period).

The research questions are therefore:

  - Does schedule-based TSP improve headway adherence for rapid transit systems?
  - Is there an average improvement, or is there a reduction only in extreme delay?
  - Is there an improvement difference by time of day or for particular portions of 
  a rapid transit route?
