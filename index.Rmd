abstract: |
  In an effort to reduce automobile delay, some
  transit signal priority systems only trigger when a transit vehicle is behind its schedule. This
  can cause a perceived discrepancy when a high-frequency transit system
  operating on a headway basis without a published schedule requires TSP: the
  passengers may feel they waited too long for the next bus when the bus is
  still running on its internal (unpublished) schedule. We report the results of
  an experiment conducted on the Utah Valley eXpress (UVX) bus rapid transit (BRT)
  system in Provo and Orem, Utah during the spring and summer of 2019. The TSP
  system varied between four settings: 0 minutes late (always give TSP), 2 minutes late,
  5 minutes late, and never.

# Questions {#intro}

Transit signal priority (TSP) is a technology that allows traffic signals to
change their timing plans to accommodate transit vehicles. This may involve
extending a green phase until the vehicle passes, triggering an early green if
there is a vehicle waiting at the light, or even running specific transit-only
phases if the transit vehicles must make a turn across the automobile traffic lanes.
TSP is an important tool in helping transit vehicles maintain on-time
performance [@Liu2018]. Often, TSP will only be triggered at a specific signal
if the vehicle is running some amount behind its schedule, thus maximizing green
time for automobiles and minimizing automobile delay when the bus is otherwise
on schedule [@NI20201]. 

In high-frequency transit systems where the goal is not schedule adherence but
rather *headway* adherence, the schedule might not be published for transit
riders. The specific vehicles might follow an internal schedule, but there could
be a discrepancy when passengers perceive a bus being "late" when it is on-time
by its unpublished schedule. The research questions are therefore:

  - Does TSP improve headway adherence for rapid transit systems?
  - Is there an average improvement, or is there a reduction only in extreme delay?
  - Does the improvement change by time of day or for particular portions of 
  a rapid transit route?
